## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

A naive Word Count implementation to better understand the **MapReduce** paradigm.

MapReduce is a programming model for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

The "MapReduce System" is usually composed of three functions (or steps):

**Map**: The map function, also referred to as the map task, processes a single key/value input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs.

**Shuffle**: The shuffle function transfer data from Mapper to Reducer. It is a mandatory operation for reducers to proceed their jobs further as the shuffling process serves as input for the reduce tasks.

**Reduce**: The reduce function, also referred to as the reduce task, consists of taking all key/value pairs produced in the map phase that share the same intermediate key and producing zero, one, or more data items.
